Students will write three 5-7 page analytical papers on the [readings]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/readings) for any three weeks of their choice. Then, they must write one 15-20 page research proposal/prospectus for the end of the term.

Many readings are available online for MIT students only in the library's E-reserves. The following sources, however, are available on sites external to MIT:

Marc J. Blecher, Hegemony and Workers' Politics in China

[Yongshun Cai, "The Resistance of Chinese Laid-Off Workers in the Reform Period](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/login)
